  "summary": "My research focuses on understanding shell formation, or “Biomineralisation” in marine organisms. Knowing the precise biological and chemical mechanisms of biomineralisation is crucial because it has implications for predicting the response of biomineralising marine organisms to climate change, as their minerals are directly affected by it. Fossil minerals serve as invaluable records of past environmental conditions, helping scientists infer historical climate patterns. Calcium carbonate shells also sequester carbon taken up from the surface into the deep ocean, influencing the global carbon cycle.",
